              question: "Are there partner companies that can support me in using Noreja?",
              answer: "Yes, Noreja has numerous partners among consultancies, system integrators, or universities who can provide services with and for Noreja Process Intelligence as needed. You can find more information in the main menu under Partners."
            },

              question: "Is there documentation and training available alongside the license for knowledge transfer?",
              answer: "Yes, the Noreja platform has its own AI-powered documentation that can be accessed. In addition, we offer regular 1:1 tool training sessions throughout the license period, so that over time, every detail of the solution can be understood."

              answer: "Generally, there is no general setup fee. Data connectivity can also be done independently or as part of the included Data-Onboarding Workshops. However, it often makes sense to get support during initial setup to efficiently and error-free connect source systems. This can be done by Noreja itself or one of our partners."

              question: "Can additional costs arise for used LLM tokens?",
              answer: "Generally, LLM tokens are included for all Power-Users. If there is a need for an increased number of \"reading\" or \"consuming\" users, we must pass on the costs. In this case, we will explicitly contact you."

            {
              question: "What are Power-Users and how do they differ from regular users?",
              answer: "We define Power-Users as users who have rights to Builder, Manager, Analyzer, and other admin functions on the Noreja platform. Excluded here are read-only users of the Dashboard or Minerva-AI."

              question: "Bietet Noreja einen Proof-Of-Value an, um die Technologie kennenzulernen?",
              answer: "Ja, 85% der Kunden starten mit einem initialen Proof-Of-Value, welchen Noreja zu einem sehr günstigen Fixpreis anbietet. Dabei wird sich i.d.R. auf einen Teilprozess fokussiert, den Noreja innerhalb von 3 bis 4 Wochen anbindet, importiert, analysiert und erste Optimierungspotenziale aufdeckt. Nach dem Proof-Of-Value sind 60% der Datenanbindung bereits erledigt, sodass anschließend in wenigen Tagen eine Operationalisierung stattfinden kann."
            },
            {
              question: "Brauche ich dedizierte Process Mining Experten, um Noreja nutzen zu können?",
              answer: "Nein. Es werden keine expliziten Process Mining Experten benötigt, um Noreja nutzen zu können. Eine Besonderheit hierbei ist, dass Noreja keine Event-Logs verwendet, sodass keine aufwendigen Datentransformationen nötig sind, die bei herkömmlichen Lösungen häufig 80% der Zeit in Anspruch nehmen."
            },
            {
              question: "Wie funktioniert der Herauf- oder Herabstufung in andere Lizenzpakete?",
              answer: "Prinzipiell werden Jahreslizenzen in bestimmten Preispaketkombinationen abgeschlossen. Eine Herabstufung in kleinere Preiskategorien ist im Anschluss an das Lizenzjahr möglich. Besteht der Bedarf in höhere Preiskategorien aufzusteigen – z.B., weil mehr Daten importiert werden sollen, so kann dies jederzeit geschehen. Allerdings werden niemals automatisch und ohne Rücksprache Preise erhöht. Dies geschieht immer im Dialog mit dem Kunden."
            },
            {
              question: "Was passiert, wenn ich das Limit in einem Paket überschreite?",
              answer: "Sollte die Kapazität der Datenmenge oder der benötigten Dimensionen nicht ausreichen kann entweder proaktiv mit der Noreja Kontakt aufgenommen werden, oder aber die Noreja meldet sich nach überschreiten der Grenzwerte und sucht das Gespräch."
            },
            {
              question: "Wie funktioniert die Lizenzverlängerung?",
              answer: "Der Lizenzvertrag wird auf Jahresbasis abgeschlossen. Laut abgeschlossenem Vertrag verlängert sich die Lizenz dabei automatisch, wenn nicht rechtzeitig gekündigt wird; Allerdings wird auch hier niemals eine stillschweigende Verlängerung durchgeführt, ohne vorab mit dem Kunden über die Verlängerung zu sprechen."
            },
            {
              question: "Wie kann ich den Lizenzvertrag kündigen?",

            {
              question: "Was genau ist im Basispaket enthalten und wie laufen die inkludierten Workshops ab?",
              answer: "Das Basispaket beinhaltet Features, Service-Leistungen und KI-Komponenten. Unter Features versteht man konkrete Software-Bestandteile, die ein Anwender auf der Plattform nutzen kann. Die Service-Leistungen inkludieren mehrere Workshops (Tagesworkshop à 8h), die Vor-Ort beim Kunden mit ein bis zwei Noreja-Experten durchgeführt werden (Reisekosten inkludiert). Zudem werden (Bi-)Weekly Online-Sessions eingeplant, in welchen die Kunden Unterstützung bei der Nutzung der Plattform aber auch der Identifizierung neuer Use Cases erhalten."
            },
            {
              question: "Kann ich die Noreja auch für zusätzliche bzw. begleitende Beratung buchen?",
              answer: "Ja, jedes Paket enthält eine Tagesrate, die genutzt werden kann, um zusätzliche Beratung, die über die inkludierten Workshops und regelmäßigen Sessions hinausgehen, zu buchen. Die Rate unterscheidet sich zwischen den Basispaketen."
            },
            {
              question: "Wo werden meine Daten gehostet?",
              answer: "Die Daten werden bei der Amazon AWS in Frankfurt gehostet. Aufgrund vollständiger Mandanten-Trennung kann auf Wunsch aber auch in anderen Cloud-Regionen oder On-Prem gehostet werden. Bei On-Prem entstehen allerdings Zusatzaufwände."

              answer: "Das private LLM-Hosting erfolgt durch den Betrieb einer eigenen und vollständig isolierten Umgebung bei einem beliebigen Cloud-Anbieter (z.B. Amazon AWS). Die Noreja setzt dabei ein beliebiges LLM (z.B. Mistral, Deepseek, Gemma, Quen3, etc.) auf, auf welches ausschließlich der Kunde Zugriff erhält."
            },

              question: "Gibt es auch Partnerunternehmen, die mich bei der Nutzung von Noreja begleiten können?",

            {
              question: "Gibt es Dokumentation und Schulungsangebote parallel zur Lizenz für den Wissenstransfer?",
              answer: "Ja, die Noreja-Plattform hat eine eigene KI-gestützte Dokumentation, auf die zugegriffen werden kann. Zudem bieten wir im Zuge der Lizenzperiode auch regelmäßige 1:1 Tool-Schulungen an, sodass mit der Zeit jeder Detail der Lösung durchdrungen werden kann."
            },
            {
              question: "Woher weiß ich, welches Paket (z.B. in Bezug auf die Datenmenge) ich wählen muss?",
              answer: "Den genauen Bedarf ermitteln wir gerne gemeinsam in einem Gespräch. Eine optimale Entscheidungsgrundlage bietet hierfür unser Proof-Of-Value, dessen Ergebnis eine gute Einschätzung zur benötigter Datenmenge und zum Servicebedarf ermöglicht."
            },
            {
              question: "Gibt es eine initiale Setup-Fee?",
              answer: "Grundsätzlich gibt es keine generelle Setup-Fee. Die Datenanbindung kann auch eigenständig bzw. im Zuge der inkludierten Data-Onboarding Workshops stattfinden. Häufig macht es aber Sinn, sich beim initialen Setup Unterstützung zu holen, um Quellsysteme effizient und fehlerfrei anzubinden. Dies kann durch die Noreja selbst oder einen unserer Partner erfolgen."
            },
            {
              question: "Können für genutzte LLM-Token zusätzliche Kosten entstehen?",
              answer: "Grundsätzlich sind die LLM-Token für alle Power-User inkludiert. Sollte es den Bedarf nach einer erhöhten Anzahl an „lesenden“ bzw. „konsumierenden“ Nutzern geben, müssen wir die Kosten weiterreichen. In diesem Fall sprechen wir dich explizit an."
            },

              question: "Was sind Power-User und wie unterscheiden sie sich von herkömmlichen Nutzern?",
